I'm a software engineer with 5+ years of experience and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I'm also an open-source collaborator, either through my own or other people's projects.

I'm that kind of person that gets bored easily, so I'm constantly studying new approaches, technologies, and paradigms to turn the tables... The dynamicity of programming is what drives me!

Oh, of course... Ghost is my son, <a  class="hover-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18064206010048203/" title="Ghost Instagram Highlight">a beautiful Akita</a>.
